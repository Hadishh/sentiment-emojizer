It will drive you crazy trying to figure out who is authentic or not- and if they aren't, what their motive is.  Celebs like $$ and press.  It could have been he just wanted the photo op.  Could it have been real?  Sure.  Self serving to get more publicity?  Equally possible.	💜🌷

I seriously hope so- the way things have been for the last year and a half just sucks. 🤨

🏓

You said a very critical word, "acting."  Celebs don't often show their true face to the public, especially during an important event like that.  Perhaps... but I doubt it.	RT @tittypickss: You Can't Stop HOT! 🥵

Backs against the wall. The Canadians steal three in the 8th end, come storming back for a crucial 6-5 extra end win over Scotland. Gutsy.

That’s three wins in a row and Canada is now 4-5 at the women’s world curling championship. #cbccurl @CBCOlympics	CANADA 🥌🇨🇦 FOR THE WIN 

Canada defeats Estonia 10-4. It’s a fourth-straight victory for the Canadians at the women’s world curling championship.
